Test results revealed Joe’s cognitive abilities borderline range, challenges attention executive function affecting task performance. Despite improvements since last evaluation, enhanced verbal skills, Joe continues show deficits working memory, task organization, fine motor skills. performance particularly affected complex tasks demand simultaneous operations. Parents teachers observe Joe made progress social interactions fewer hyperactive behaviors past. However, attention problems remain persistent, evidenced difficulties task initiation maintaining focus, significantly affect learning daily activities.
