Joe 8-year-old boy history premature birth, Tourette syndrome, ADHD affecting attention executive function. exhibits reduced auditory visual attention span, working memory challenges, executive dysfunction impacting task performance organization. intellectual functioning borderline stronger verbal nonverbal skills. Despite attentional issues, Joe demonstrates effective spontaneous language adequate verbal memory supported, though processing speed comprehension age expectations. motor skills show impaired fine motor control balance, influenced persistent motor tics difficulties graphomotor accuracy. Adaptive skills study habits remain expectations noted struggles planning completing complex tasks independently. Joe’s ability integrate complex information across modalities limited, contributing challenges academic achievement daily functional independence. requires consistent external support task routines, organization, self-regulation benefits structured, small group academic instruction, accommodations workload reductions extended time. Significant behavioral improvements, likely related medication, observed, though residual hyperactivity tic behaviors persist. learning difficulties consistent neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities linked prematurity neuropsychiatric conditions, requiring coordinated medical, psychiatric, educational interventions. Recommendations emphasize ongoing small group teaching, executive function support, preferential classroom seating, scheduled breaks, careful monitoring workload, continued pharmacological behavioral management. Regular neuropsychological follow-ups advised monitor progress adjust interventions accordingly. Strengths: - Joe communicates spontaneously fluently, showing good verbal language skills (PTO:Class_376, Language Ability). - Verbal working memory performance relatively intact supported conditions (PTO:Class_176, Working Memory). - Joe participates well sports activities, indicating preserved gross motor skills (PTO:Class_301, Gross Motor Skills). - Improvement teacher-rated executive function scales behavior since last evaluation (PTO:Class_455, Executive Function). - Adequate comprehension multiple repetitions structured support (PTO:Class_455, Receptive Language). Weaknesses: - Attention deficits impacting auditory visual span, self-regulation, task persistence (PTO:Class_163, Attention Deficit Disorder Hyperactivity). - Borderline intellectual functioning weaknesses nonverbal reasoning processing speed (PTO:Class_519, IQ). - Impaired fine motor skills praxis difficulties handwriting motor coordination (PTO:Class_301, Motor Skills). - Difficulty integrating complex multi-load information leading task performance deterioration (PTO:Class_219, Adaptation Task Complexity). - -average adaptive life skills, particularly study skills organizing materials (PTO:Class_340, Adaptive Life Skills). Needs: - Continued small group instruction focusing reading, arithmetic, executive functioning (PTO:Class_219, Reading Writing). - External modeling guided practice multi-step routines homework management (PTO:Class_455, Executive Function). - Classroom accommodations including preferential seating, reduced workload, extended time, frequent breaks (PTO:Class_455, Task Completion). - Ongoing psychiatric behavioral support medication management tic-related psychosocial impacts (PTO:Class_138, Medications). - Structured daily schedules active prompts enhance attention assist transitions comprehension (PTO:Class_455, Planning).","code":"stopifnot(nchar(Sys.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))>0) library(wizrd) library(llm4np) pretty_rmd <- function(x) {     x |> strwrap() |> paste(\">\", text = _, collapse = \"\\n\") |> cat() } deidpath = system.file(\"pdfs\", \"de-identified+report+1.pdf\", package=\"llm4np\") deid = parse_nppdf(deidpath) deid ## Parsed NP pdf with 7 pages and 9 tables. nt = gsub(\"\\\\n\", \" \", paste(deid@text, collapse=\" \")) substr(nt,1130,1210) ## [1] \" Tests of Visual Motor Integration (VMI) and Visual Perception (VP); Gray Oral Re\" data(nmdf) head(nmdf) ##         tag                                           val ## 1 Class_634                 Obstetric Delivery Procedures ## 2 Class_385                             Perinatal History ## 3 Class_464 Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity ## 4 Class_455                              Mental Disorders ## 5 Class_689                   Psychiatric Hospitalization ## 6 Class_138                       Psychologic Indications ag = openai_agent(\"gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14\") |>    instruct(\"You are a helpful assistant with training in neuropsychology.\") ag ## <wizrd::Agent> gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14 ## @instructions: You are a helpful assistant with training in neuropsychology. ## @io: <wizrd::PlainTextFormat> → ← <wizrd::PlainTextFormat> ## @tools:  ## @params:  ## @backend: <wizrd::OpenAIAPIServer> https://api.openai.com prompted_agent <- ag |> prompt_as( \"Please summarize the text {txt} in five short paragraphs of at most 45 words.
