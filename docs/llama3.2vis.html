<p>Based on the provided information, I will attempt to produce the requested paragraphs and lists of tags. Please note that this will require some interpretation and summarization of the extensive list of ‘val’ fields.</p>
<p><strong>Paragraphs:</strong></p>
<p>The child has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD), a mental disorder that affects a person’s ability to regulate attention and behavior. According to the medical history, the child exhibited symptoms of motor skills development, including hand patting, heel-toe sequencing, and finger repetition. These symptoms, along with an abnormal posture, were indicative of neurological issues. The child has also been observed to exhibit restricted and repetitive behavior, such as insisting on order, restricted range of interests, and insisting on rituals and routines. These observations suggest a possible autism phenotype or pervasive child developmental disorder.</p>
<p>The child’s receptive language skills are within the average range, but expressive phonology and morphology skills are below the average range. The child has not demonstrated significant receptive syntax or receptive semantics skills. This suggests difficulties with verbal communication, specifically with expression and comprehension. The child has also shown difficulty with initiating and responding to social overtures, which may indicate challenges with interpersonal interactions and social competence.</p>
<p>The child’s medical history includes a diagnosis of asthma, eczema, and a congenital heart defect. Additionally, the child has exhibited an excessive range of interests, unusual sensory interests, and a self-injurious behavior. These symptoms and diagnoses are indicative of possible respiratory indications, allergenic responses, and immune dysfunction. Furthermore, the child has demonstrated poor eating behavior, difficulty managing internal emotions, and difficulty with task initiation. These symptoms suggest potential difficulties with food and water use, emotional regulation, and executive function.</p>
